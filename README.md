# Łukasz Holc - Personal Portfolio

A modern, responsive personal portfolio website built with Node.js, Express, and Tailwind CSS. Features beautiful animations, excellent UX, and a professional design that showcases my work as a full-stack developer.

Due to the nature of portfolio and rather small scope of project, I have decided to keep it without any js framework.

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
